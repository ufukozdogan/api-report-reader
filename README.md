# API Report Reader Spring Boot Web Application

### About Application
* Main goal of the application is to communicate with an API. Sending post requests and receiving response parameters.
* User logs in to the API system with given credentials and afterwards, has full access to the system.
* There are couple of commands that can user make. Such as requesting transaction lists or client information.

### What did I use?
* Spring Boot
* Bootstrap
* JPA and JSP
* JavaScript
* jQuery and AJAX

#### Note: The API itself given to myself by the company that develops and maintains it and they keep the login credentials. The web application presented here is just a pointless service without them. To use it, acquire yourself a working API and modify the links within the app according to your system.
